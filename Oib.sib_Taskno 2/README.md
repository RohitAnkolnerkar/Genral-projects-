# Email Spam Detection with M.L.
n this task, I used the SMS Spam collection dataset.

Then, I trained the model using a Count Vectorizer and Logistic Regression Algorithms.

There are many analyses that were done, and a few visualizations were also done.

Finally, Using the Multinomial Algorithm, made a model and predicted using custom words.
